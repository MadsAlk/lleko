This is an IOT project of a smart home system consisting of a raspberry pi, and controlled via voice controls through the internet.<br>
I used dialog flow to process the voice commands, and flask to to handle the requests. <br>
The system can be used to control lights and to display time or temperature onto an LCD display, it can also be customized for any other commands like controlling motors and devices.<br>
Face Recognition AI was used with the raspberry pi camera to unlock the gate to the home.
